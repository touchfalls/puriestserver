# puriest server

## This is an optimized version of the server on the Purpur nucleus, but minecraft remains the same functional and without removing AI in monsters and residents
### The repository uses the purpur nucleus version 1.21.8, version of [Build 2497](https://api.purpurmc.org/v2/purpur/1.21.8/2497/download).
### All optimization lines are signed, I did optimization as I would do it on my server so I advise you to look at the changed files and draw a conclusion for yourself
