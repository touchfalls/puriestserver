network-compression-threshold=256 # This allows you to set the cap for the size of a packet before the server attempts to compress it. Setting it higher can save some CPU resources at the cost of bandwidth, and setting it to -1 disables it. Setting this higher may also hurt clients with slower network connections. If your server is in a network with a proxy or on the same machine (with less than 2 ms ping), disabling this (-1) will be beneficial, since internal network speeds can usually handle the additional uncompressed traffic.

simulation-distance=4 # Simulation distance is distance in chunks around the player that the server will tick. Essentially the distance from the player that things will happen. This includes furnaces smelting, crops and saplings growing, etc. This is an option you want to purposefully set low, somewhere around 3 or 4, because of the existence of view-distance. This allows to load more chunks without ticking them. This effectively allows players to see further without the same performance impact.

sync-chunk-writes=false # This option is forcibly set to false on Paper and its forks, but on other server implementations you need to switch this to false manually. This allows the server to save chunks off the main thread, lessening the load on the main tick loop.

view-distance=7 # This is the distance in chunks that will be sent to players, similar to no-tick-view-distance from paper. The total view distance will be equal to the greatest value between simulation-distance and view-distance. For example, if the simulation distance is set to 4, and the view distance is 12, the total distance sent to the client will be 12 chunks.
